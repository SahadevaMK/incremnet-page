# incrementoperator

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
 It is the data or information that needs to
be exchanged between the sender and the receiver.
Messages can be in the form of text, number, image,
audio, video, multimedia, etc.
Communication media: It is the path through which
the message travels between source and destination.
It is also called medium or link which is either wired
or wireless. For example, a television cable, telephone
cable, ethernet cable, satellite link, microwaves, etc.
We will study about various communication media in
section 11.5.
Protocols: It is a set of rules that need to be followed by
the communicating parties in order to have successful
and reliable data communication. You have already
come across protocols such as Ethernet and HTTP.
11.3 MEASURING CAPACITY OF COMMUNICATION MEDIA
In data communication, the transmission medium is
also known as channel. The capacity of a channel is the
maximum amount of signals or traffic that a channel
can carry. It is measured in terms of bandwidth and
data transfer rate as described below:
11.3.1 Bandwidth
Bandwidth of a channel is the range of frequencies
available for transmission of data through that channel.
Higher the bandwidth, higher the data transfer rate.
Normally, bandwidth is the difference of maximum and
minimum frequency contained in the composite signals.
Bandwidth is measured in Hertz (Hz).
1 KHz =1000 Hz
1 MHz =1000 KHz = 1000000 Hz
11.3.2 Data Transfer Rate
Data travels in the form of signals over a channel. One
signal carries one or more bits over the channel. Data
transfer rate is the number of bits transmitted between
source and destination in one second. It is also known
as bit rate. It is measured in terms of bits per second
(bps). The higher units for data transfer rates are:
1 Kbps=210 bps=1024 bps
1 Mbps=220 bps=1024 Kbps
1 Gbps=230 bps=1024 Mbps
1 Tbps=240 bps=1024 Gbps
Activity 11.2
Find out how
many hertz is
10 Megahertz.
MBps stands for
Megabyte per
second whereas
Mbps stands
for Megabit per
second.

206 COMPUTER SCIENCE - CLASS XII Example 11.1 A user wants to upload a text document at
the rate of 10 pages per 20 second. What will be the required
data rate of the channel? (Assume that 1 page contains 1600
characters and each character is of 8 bits).
Solution:
11.4 TYPES OF DATA COMMUNICATION
Data communication happens in the form of signals
between two or more computing devices or nodes.
The transfer of data happens over a point-to-point
or multipoint communication channel. Data
communication between different devices are broadly
categorised into 3 types: Simplex communication, Halfduplex communication, and Full-duplex communication.
11.4.1 Simplex Communication
It is a one way or unidirectional communication between
two devices in which one device is sender and other one
is receiver. Devices use the entire capacity of the link
to transmit the data. It is like a one way street where
vehicles can move in only one direction. For example,
data entered through a keyboard or audio sent to a
speaker are one way communications.
With the advent of IoT, controlling home appliances
is another example of simplex communication as shown
in the Figure 11.3. One can control fans, lights, fridge,
oven etc. while sitting in the office or driving a car.
Figure 11.3: Simplex communication
11.4.2 Half-duplex Communication
It is two way or bidirectional communication between two
devices in which both the devices can send and receive
data or control signals in both directions, but not at the
same time, as shown in Figure 11.4. While one device is
sending data, the other one will receive and vice-versa. It
is like sharing a one-way narrow bridge among vehicles 
The computers can be classified into various categories as given below:
 Micro Computer
 Laptop Computer
 Work Station
 Super Computer
 Main Frame
 Hand Held
 Multi core
Micro Computer: A personal computer; designed to meet the computer needs of an
individual. Provides access to a wide variety of computing applications, such as word
processing, photo editing, e-mail, and internet.
Laptop Computer: A portable, compact computer that can run on power supply or a battery
unit. All components are integrated as one compact unit. It is generally more expensive than a
comparable desktop. It is also called a Notebook.
Work Station: Powerful desktop computer designed for specialized tasks. Generally used for
tasks that requires a lot of processing speed. Can also be an ordinary personal computer
attached to a LAN (local area network).
